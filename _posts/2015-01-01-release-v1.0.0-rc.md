Curriculr version `v1.0.0-rc` was released today after a series of beta versions. This release fixes a couple of issues found in the latest beta version, makes a few minor translation corrections and contains more test coverage especially after switching from factory girl to fixtures and from rspec to minitext. It also includes support of the latest stable version of Rails `4.2`.

This release is available [here](https://github.com/curriculr/curriculr/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc) for download.
