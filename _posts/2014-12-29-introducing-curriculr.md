Curriculr is an open and interactive learning platform that supports both MOOCs (Massive Online Open Courses) and courses with limited-audiences. Whether your course is public or private, for arts or mathematics, literature or technology, instruction or training, Curriculr provides a simple and powerful platform for all.

It was desinged to be:

- **Full-fledged**: Instructors can create courses and organize their contents into units and lectures with videos, audios, images, and documents. Students can enroll in classes, participate in discussions, attend lectures, attempt quizzes and exams, and track their progress.

- **Internationalized**: It comes out of the box with support for two locales `en` (English) and `ar` (Arabic); and other locales can easily be added.

- **Multi-tenant**: Tenants, which are called accounts (not to be confused with user accounts) are identified by subdomains and are completely separate from one another. Each account (tenant) acts as if it is a separate site with its own configuration, courses, users and theme.

- **Themeable**: It supports themes and theme inheritance. Adding a new theme can be as easy as providing a name and changing a few CSS style classes.

- **Extensible**: It was designed to be extensible by means of other gems, plugins or mountable engines; just like any other Rails application.
