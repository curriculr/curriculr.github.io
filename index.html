		<h3>Designed for MOOCs</h3> 

		Curriculr was designed from the very begining with Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) in mind. This is reflected in both its feature set and the way it was implemented.

		<h3>Full-fledged</h3>

		It allows instructors to create courses and organize their contents into units and lectures with videos, audios, images, and documents. Students can participate in discussions, attend lectures, attempt quizzes and exams, and track their progress.

		<h3>Internationalized</h3>

		I started this project because I wanted to offer my own classes in Arabic. As a result, Curriculr comes out of the box with support for two locals `en` (English) and `ar` (Arabic), and others can easily be added.

		<h3>Multi-tenant</h3>

		It support multitenancy. Tenants are called accounts (which are identified by subdomains and are different from users). They are completely separate from one another. Each account (tenant) has its own configuration, courses, users and theme.

		<h3>Themeable</h3>

		It supports themes and theme inheritance. It comes with a theme based on Twitter Bootstrap with four flavors (colors if you will). Adding a new theme can be as easy as providing a name and changing a few CSS style classes.

		<h3>Extensible</h3> 

		And because there are always going to be features that are needed or nice to have that Curriculr does not provide out of the box, it was designed to be extensible by means of other gems, plugins or mountable engines.
